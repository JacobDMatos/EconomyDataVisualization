# EconomyDataVisualization
This is a WIP repository meant to display graphs showing different economic statistics across different nations. To accomplish this, economic data sets will need to be imported into an SQL database. Relevant data will then need to be extrapolated using SQL, leading to that data being exported into separate CSV files. These new CSV files will then be brought into Python, where matplotlib will handle displaying all relevant data onto graphs.

All data used in this project was obtained from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's public database, found at this link under Economic Projections/OECD Economic Outlook/OECD Economic Outlook latest edition/ Economic Outlook No. 112 - November 2022./EO By Subject(GDP, Unemployment...): https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=DP_LIVE
